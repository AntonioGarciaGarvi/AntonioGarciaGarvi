## Hi there 👋
I am an engineer in Industrial Electronics and Automation, with a particular passion for Computer Vision💻👁️ and Deep Learning. Currently, I work as a researcher🔍 at the Automatics and Industrial Informatics Research Institute (ai2) of the Universidad Politécnica de Valencia (UPV) , where I am pursuing my doctoral thesis on automating experiments🔬 with C. elegans nematodes 🪱 using computer vision techniques. Specifically, my work involves developing algorithms for the detection, segmentation, and classification of these nematodes using deep learning models. Additionally, I am proposing strategies to train these models in situations where large amounts of data are unavailable.
